# Main Stories
 
1. As a developer, I want to make at least 15 consistent commits with good, descriptive messages.

2. As a user, I want to be able to search for someone based on a single criterion
    You should be able to find and return a list of people who match the search

3. As a user, I want to be able to look up someone’s information after I find them with the program (display values for the various traits of the found person).

4. As a user, after locating a person, I want to see only that person’s immediate family members, displaying the names of the family members and their relation to the found person.
    i.e., spouse, parents, siblings

5. As a user, after locating a person, I want to see only that person’s descendants (display the names of the descendants).

6. As a user, I want to be able to search for someone based on multiple traits (up to a maximum of five criteria at once).
    i.e., if you search for Gender: male and Eye Color: blue, you should get back a list of people who match the search. In this case, it will be only people who are male with blue eyes.

7. As a developer, I want to run validation on any user input, ensuring that a user is re-prompted when they provide invalid input.
Tackle this user story LAST!

# Bonus Stories

1. As a user, after locating a person, I want to see only that person’s descendants (display the names of the descendants), using recursion.

# End Result

The finished application will be a single website with a button that, when clicked, will allow the user to interact with the dataset. The user will be able to search by name or by traits, and when a person is found, they will be able to see information about the person, along with their family members and descendants.
